# Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less
# 
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
# blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
# you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
# and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
# 
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.
# 
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
# 
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
# 
#  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#    vary here
# 
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
# like this:

# Resolves: #123
# See also: #456, #789

#    Simplify serialize.h's exception handling
# 
#    Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream
#    implementations, as well as related methods.
# 
#    As exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always
#    called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an
#    exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate
#    with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead
#    code).
# 
#    As a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are
#    only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced
#    by !eof().
# 
#    fail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete
#    them.
